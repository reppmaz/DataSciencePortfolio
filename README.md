This repository presents four projects that highlight my expertise in data preprocessing, statistical analysis, and machine learning using Python and R. These projects were initially developed during my doctoral research and work as a research associate. They leverage data from a multi-site brain imaging study, examining various data modalities before, during, and after a stress induction procedure. Key stress markers include fMRI blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) signals, negative affect ratings, heart rate, and salivary levels of cortisol and alpha-amylase. Additional variables encompass age, gender, psychological resilience, and various health behaviors. For data protection reasons, the original scripts have been reduced and anonymized to exclude any participant or sample-specific information.

Projects Overview

Project 1: Bayesian Inference for Brain Response Analysis
In this project, Bayesian inference, particularly Bayesian ANOVAs, is employed to explore differences in BOLD signals across five study sites during an fMRI task (ScanSTRESS task). The primary objective is to identify and quantify variations in brain activity patterns among these sites.

Project 2: Linear Mixed Models for Stress Response Analysis
This project investigates the effects of a stress induction procedure (ScanSTRESS) on timeseries data of various psychological and physiological stress markers using linear mixed models (LMMs). The analysis involves preprocessing raw data, feature extraction, and modeling stress responses across different phases.

Project 3: Multiple Linear Regression for Psychological Resilience Prediction
This project focuses on predicting psychological resilience using brain connectivity features. It includes analysis of fMRI connectivity data collected before, during and after the ScanSTRESS task, targeting key brain networks and their interactions. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, feature extraction, and statistical modeling techniques, particularly Multiple Linear Regression (MLR).

Project 4: Machine Learning for Psychological Resilience Prediction
This project showcases the use of machine learning techniques to predict psychological resilience, incorporating a range of demographic, behavioral, and physiological features, along with stress response markers. Data from multiple study sites were utilized, with one site specifically designated as the validation dataset.
